            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Lack of Awareness and Understanding:</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> Many organizations and developers lack sufficient awareness of the
                  importance of incorporating security considerations <em>early</em> in the software development
                  lifecycle (SDLC). This includes a lack of understanding of the specific security risks associated with
                  their projects and the benefits of proactive requirements analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Leads to insecure software, increased risk of breaches, costly remediation
                  efforts, and damage to reputation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. Complexity of Security Requirements:</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> Defining, documenting, and managing comprehensive security requirements
                  can be complex. This is especially true for projects with intricate functionality, multiple
                  stakeholders, and evolving threat landscapes. Security standards and regulations (e.g., OWASP, NIST,
                  ISO 27001) add another layer of complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Incomplete or poorly defined security requirements result in vulnerabilities,
                  compliance failures, and difficulties in demonstrating security assurance.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. Integration with Existing Development Processes:</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> Integrating security requirements evaluation tools and processes into
                  existing SDLCs can be challenging. This includes a lack of seamless integration with development
                  tools, version control systems, and automated testing frameworks. Resistance to change from
                  development teams is possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Disjointed workflows, increased overhead, and delays in development cycles.
                  Security becomes an afterthought rather than an integral part of the process.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">4. Manual and Time-Consuming Evaluation:</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> The traditional methods of evaluating security requirements, such as
                  manual reviews and checklists, are time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to scale.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Delays in identifying security flaws, increased costs, and the inability to
                  keep pace with the volume of software being developed.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <div className="mb-4">
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Skill Gap and Expertise Shortage:</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> A shortage of skilled security professionals who can effectively analyze
                  requirements and identify vulnerabilities exists. This includes a lack of expertise in threat
                  modeling, security testing, and secure coding practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Reliance on less-qualified personnel, potentially leading to inadequate
                  security assessments and an increased risk of vulnerabilities being overlooked.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> Existing security tools and services can be expensive, particularly for
                  smaller organizations and startups. This can create a barrier to entry, especially for early-stage
                  projects with limited budgets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Organizations may be forced to forego or delay security measures, leading to
                  increased risk.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <li>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> The ever-changing threat landscape requires continuous adaptation of
                  security requirements and evaluation processes. New vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and compliance
                  requirements emerge constantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impact:</strong> Security measures become outdated quickly, leading to a constant need for
                  updates and re-evaluation, adding to the workload and cost.
