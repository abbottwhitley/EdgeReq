        <h2>Product Concept Overview</h2>
        <p>
          EdgeReq Analytics is a SaaS solution designed to proactively evaluate software requirements for security
          risks. The concept was developed in response to the growing need for &quot;shift-left&quot; security practices that
          identify vulnerabilities earlier in the software development lifecycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>
          EdgeReq Analytics enables organizations to identify and address security vulnerabilities at the requirements
          stage, before a single line of code is written. This proactive approach results in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced development costs by preventing security flaws early</li>
          <li>Faster time-to-market with secure products</li>
          <li>Improved compliance with security standards and regulations</li>
          <li>Enhanced overall security posture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Product Features</h2>
        <h3>1. Automated Requirements Analysis</h3>

        <h3>2. Security Risk Identification</h3>
        <p>
          The platform identifies potential security risks based on industry best practices, common vulnerability
          patterns, and compliance requirements. Each identified risk is categorized by severity and potential impact.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Actionable Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
          For each identified risk, EdgeReq Analytics provides clear, actionable recommendations to address the
          vulnerability. These recommendations are tailored to the specific context and include examples and references
          to security best practices.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Compliance Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          The platform maps requirements to relevant compliance standards and frameworks, helping organizations ensure
          regulatory adherence from the earliest stages of development.
