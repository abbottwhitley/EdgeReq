    *   **Strategy:**  VCs may be less interested in very early seed stage. It is, however, important to understand this potential funding source, as EdgeReq Analytics could be a good fit, depending on the team's experience, market potential, and traction. Focus on building relationships, preparing a detailed business plan and pitch deck, and targeting VCs who invest in cybersecurity, SaaS, and DevOps.
