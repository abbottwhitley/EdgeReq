**2. Developers' Lack of Prioritization of Security:**

*   **Description:** Some posts suggest that developers may not always prioritize security, leading to insecure code and vulnerabilities. This could be due to a lack of awareness, training, or time constraints.
*   **Validation:** The initial context notes this. Further searches reveal that this is a frequently discussed issue. Several sources point to a lack of prioritization, including survey results.
*   **Quantification:** Threads like "How do you make your developers care about security?" indicate this as a recurring issue.  Surveys and articles suggest a large percentage of developers do not prioritize security.

**3. Lack of Clear Security Requirements:**

*   **Description:** The need for well-defined security requirements is apparent. Without clear guidelines, it becomes difficult to build secure software.
*   **Validation:** The initial context identifies this. Search results for "software security requirements best practices" reveal resources and guidelines on defining and implementing security requirements, confirming the need.
*   **Quantification:** Discussion threads focus on the challenges of defining and implementing security requirements, highlighting the need for best practices and guidelines.

**4. Difficulties in Software Pre-Installation Checks:**

*   **Description:** Users and administrators struggle with how to adequately vet software before installation. Current methods (e.g., manual review, searching online) are often insufficient.
*   **Validation:** This is a key identified pain point, verified by multiple posts on Reddit and other sources. Searching for "software pre-installation security checks" highlights the steps involved (checking sources, verifying integrity, scanning for malware) and confirms the complexity.
*   **Quantification:** Multiple posts on Reddit discuss methods of checking software for vulnerabilities, but indicate challenges in the process.
