    *   **Disadvantages:** Valuation can be challenging, potential for differing opinions on strategy.
    *   **Strategy:** Target angel investors with experience in cybersecurity, SaaS, or software development. Network through industry events, online platforms (e.g., AngelList, Gust), and personal connections. Prepare a compelling pitch deck and business plan.
    *   **Examples:** AngelList ([https://angel.co/](https://angel.co/))

*   **Venture Capital (VC):**

    *   **Description:** Firms that invest in high-growth potential companies, typically in later seed rounds or Series A rounds.
