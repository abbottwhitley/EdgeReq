## Consumer Pain Points and Unmet Needs: Software Requirements Evaluation for Security Risks

Based on the analysis of Reddit and online forums, the following pain points and unmet needs related to software requirements evaluation for security risks were identified:

**1. Difficulty Assessing Software Security:**

*   **Description:** Users express challenges in determining the security posture of software, particularly before installation or use. This includes a lack of clear methods to assess the risk associated with a new piece of software.
*   **Quantification:**  Multiple threads on both Reddit and forums discuss the challenges of evaluating software security (e.g., "How do you determine what software is safe to use" on Reddit, and general discussions about security risks on forums).

    *   Various forum discussions on security risks.

**2. Developers' Lack of Prioritization of Security:**

*   **Description:** Some posts suggest that developers may not always prioritize security, leading to insecure code and vulnerabilities. This could be due to a lack of awareness, training, or time constraints.
*   **Quantification:** Threads like "How do you make your developers care about security?" indicate this as a recurring issue.
