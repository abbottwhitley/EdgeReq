# Masterplan: MY Threat Modeling Platform (MTMP)

## App Overview and Objectives

MY Threat Modeling Platform (MTMP) is a collaborative, automated threat modeling tool designed to integrate seamlessly into the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It helps teams model systems visually, identify threats, and map appropriate countermeasuresâ€”reducing time, improving security posture, and enabling early mitigation.

## Target Audience

* Startups and mid-sized DevOps teams
* Security-conscious engineering teams looking to implement secure SDLC practices
* Organizations subject to compliance standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, NIST 800-53, or OWASP

## Core Features and Functionality

* **Diagramming Interface**: Web-based visual diagram editor (draw\.io-style) for modeling system architecture and data flows
* **Automated Threat Modeling**: Rules engine analyzes diagrams and updates threat models using contextual libraries
* **Threat & Countermeasure Libraries**: Built-in libraries (e.g., MITRE EMB3D) to enrich threat models
* **Import Support**: Upload and analyze Visio (VSDX) files
* **Requirements Linkage**: Upload requirement documents and link them to threats
* **Multi-user Collaboration**: Real-time concurrent editing, comments, and version control
* **Versioning**: Complete change history, version comparison, and reversion
* **Communication Integration**: Slack and MS Teams for team discussions
* **User Roles and Permissions**: Granular access control by project or feature
* **Compliance Support**: Mapping threats and countermeasures to standards

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

* **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based) for scalability, SSR benefits, and rich UX
* **Backend**: NestJS for modular and maintainable APIs
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational, open-source) with Drizzle ORM for type-safe access
* **Authentication**: SSO support with OAuth2/SAML integration
* **File Uploads**: AWS S3 or similar for document storage
* **Infrastructure**: Cloud-first (e.g., AWS or Azure) to allow for real-time editing, scalability, and integrations

## Conceptual Data Model (Simplified)

* **Users**: Roles, permissions, SSO identity
* **Projects**: Metadata, ownership, visibility
* **ThreatModels**: Linked to projects; stores diagram structure, components, and data flows
* **Components**: Visual + functional metadata (assets handled, functions used)
* **Threats**: Derived from rules engine, linked to components and flows
* **Countermeasures**: Mapped to threats based on context
* **Documents**: Uploaded requirements and linked threats
* **ActivityLog**: Tracks changes, users, and timestamps

## User Interface Design Principles

* Clean, intuitive layout with drag-and-drop canvas
* Minimalist sidebar for navigating threats, countermeasures, and settings
* Modal dialogs for component property editing
* Table views for reviewing threats with bulk editing/filtering
* Real-time cursor presence for collaboration

## Security Considerations

* Centralized user data storage with encryption at rest and in transit
* Role-based access control for features and projects
* SSO via secure identity providers (e.g., Okta, Azure AD)
* Input sanitization for uploaded files (e.g., VSDX)
* Threat modeling engine sandboxing to prevent abuse

## Development Phases or Milestones

**Phase 1: MVP**

* System diagramming
* Basic threat model generation engine
* User authentication (SSO)
* PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM setup

**Phase 2: Collaboration**

* Real-time multi-user editing
* Versioning and comparison
* Requirements upload and linking

**Phase 3: Integration & Expansion**

* Slack/MS Teams integration
* Compliance standards mapping
* ALM tools integration (Jira, TFS, Rally)

**Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness**

* Role-based access control
* Reporting and analytics
* Audit log & advanced permissions

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

* **Diagram Parsing Complexity**: Developing robust Visio (VSDX) import parsing; solution: leverage open-source VSDX parsers or Microsoft Graph API.
* **Concurrency Conflicts**: Ensure CRDT/OT or WebSocket-based state sync for real-time editing.
* **Threat Model Accuracy**: Keeping libraries current and improving the rules engine.
* **Compliance Mapping**: Manual effort to build initial mappings; solution: use standards as schemas for alignment.

## Future Expansion Possibilities

* ML/AI-based threat suggestions
* Support for additional modeling standards (e.g., SysML, UML)
* Full offline mode via desktop wrapper (Tauri)
* Multi-language support for global teams
* OpenAPI or GraphQL API for external automation
