## Business Proposition: EdgeReq - Automated Software Requirements Security Analysis

**1. Core Value Proposition:**

EdgeReq is a focused application that proactively evaluates uploaded software requirements for qualities that may introduce downstream security risks. It shifts security left in the SDLC by identifying potential vulnerabilities early in the requirements phase, providing actionable insights and recommendations to developers. EdgeReq enables organizations to build more secure software, reduce the cost of remediation, and improve compliance.

**2. Key Differentiators:**

*   **Proactive Requirements Analysis:** Unlike tools focused solely on code scanning or penetration testing, EdgeReq analyzes requirements documents (e.g., written specifications, user stories) *before* code is written.
*   **Automated Security Requirements Validation:** EdgeReq automatically identifies potential security weaknesses in requirements by analyzing natural language text, identifying ambiguities, inconsistencies, and missing security controls based on predefined rules and industry best practices (OWASP, NIST).
*   **Actionable Recommendations:** EdgeReq provides clear, concise, and actionable recommendations to developers, including specific suggestions for improving requirements, identifying potential vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation issues, authentication gaps), and suggesting security controls.
*   **Integration with SDLC:** EdgeReq integrates seamlessly with existing development and DevOps workflows, including CI/CD pipelines, allowing for automated requirements analysis as part of the software development process.
*   **Focus on Supply Chain Security:** Analyzes requirements for dependencies on external components and suggests security best practices for managing supply chain risks.
*   **Compliance Support:** Assists with achieving and maintaining compliance with relevant regulatory standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA) by identifying requirements gaps and mapping requirements to compliance controls.
*   **Customizable Rule Sets:** Allows users to customize rule sets and define specific security requirements relevant to their organization and projects.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a clear and intuitive interface for uploading requirements, viewing analysis results, and accessing recommendations. The interface will allow different views, customized by user roles.
*   **Reporting and Metrics:** Generates comprehensive reports and provides metrics on security risk assessment, vulnerability identification, and requirements quality.

**3. Target Audience:**

*   Software development teams
*   Security engineers and architects
*   Project managers
*   Compliance officers
*   Organizations in regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare)
*   Any organization aiming to improve the security of its software development process.

**4. Features:**

*   Requirements Upload: Accepts various document formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .txt).
*   Automated Analysis: Uses natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based engines to analyze requirements.
*   Vulnerability Identification: Detects potential security risks based on OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, and other industry standards.
*   Risk Assessment: Provides risk scores based on severity and likelihood of occurrence.
*   Recommendation Engine: Generates actionable suggestions for improving requirements.
*   Reporting and Visualization: Generates comprehensive reports and visualizes results.
*   Integration APIs: Provides APIs for integration with CI/CD pipelines and other development tools.
*   Customizable Rules: Allows for custom rule creation and modification.
*   User Roles and Permissions: Role-based access control for different users and teams.

**5. Revenue Model:**

*   Subscription-based pricing (e.g., per user, per project, or based on the number of requirements analyzed).
*   Tiered pricing based on features and usage.
*   Potential for add-on services such as custom rule development and consulting.

This proposition directly addresses the identified pain points by offering a proactive, automated solution for evaluating software requirements for security risks, with a strong focus on integration, clear recommendations, and compliance support.
